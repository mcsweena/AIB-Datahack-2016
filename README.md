# AIB DataHack - Predicting Irish house energy ratings using supervised machine learning methods

### Notebooks

**Part 1** - Initial Data Exploration (Completed) [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mcsweena/AIB-Datahack-2016/blob/master/Part1-Initial-Data-Exploration.ipynb) 

**Part 2** - Deeper Exploration (In progress)

### Objective
During my recent career break, where I returned to college to study for an M.Sc in Business Analytics at UCD Smurfit, myself and my good buddy [Pete](https://twitter.com/padams02) decided to take on the AIB Datahack which was held in, I think, November 2016. The Datahack was hosted by AIB in their head office in Dublin 4, and consisted of a full days work (8 hours) tackling a machine learning problem.

The challenge we were presented with that morning was a supervised learning problem. Armed with only our laptops, the following challange was presented to us: **Could we find a method to accurately predict energy ratings for houses in Ireland based on a set of characteristics that the house had.** We went into the competition confident that we knew what we were doing, but it quickly dawned on us that we still had a lot to learn. All in all, it proved to be a very worthwhile experience and focused us both on what we needed to learn over the coming months.

Now that I've completed my course and have returned to work, I'm going to try and tackle the problem again in my spare time, and see if I can do a little better this time around.

### Challenge

In our Datathon challenge, you will be required to use analytical tools and machine learning models to solve an energy related problem. The challenge will not be revealed until the day of the event.

Participants will be required to prepare a dataset for analysis (the raw data for the challenge will be supplied to everyone on USB sticks) and to solve a problem based on this data. The problem has been chosen to be solvable using a large assortment of different analytical techniques, from using only SQL commands to advanced machine learning.

Participants are encouraged to use whatever programming language or analysis program they are most experienced with so teams are welcome to use R, Python, SQL, Excel, Matlab, Octave, Java , Weka or anything else they think might be useful. Over the course of the day Data Scientists from the AIB Data Innovation team will be available to help teams with any problems that might pop up. Donâ€™t worry about annoying us with questions, we'll be there to help!

If you are interested in data analysis, math, programming and winning large cash prizes then the Datathon Challenge might be the challenge for you!
