# AIB DataHack

In our Datathon challenge, you will be required to use analytical tools and machine learning models to solve an energy related problem. The challenge will not be revealed until the day of the event.

Participants will be required to prepare a dataset for analysis (the raw data for the challenge will be supplied to everyone on USB sticks) and to solve a problem based on this data. The problem has been chosen to be solvable using a large assortment of different analytical techniques, from using only SQL commands to advanced machine learning.

Participants are encouraged to use whatever programming language or analysis program they are most experienced with so teams are welcome to use R, Python, SQL, Excel, Matlab, Octave, Java , Weka or anything else they think might be useful. Over the course of the day Data Scientists from the AIB Data Innovation team will be available to help teams with any problems that might pop up. Donâ€™t worry about annoying us with questions, we'll be there to help!

If you are interested in data analysis, math, programming and winning large cash prizes then the Datathon Challenge might be the challenge for you!
